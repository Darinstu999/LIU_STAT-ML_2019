<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage
As you can see in the catalog, each file includes course lectures, labs and lab_nightmare. And they have been compressed for download.

I added .DS_Store to the .gitignore file, the purpose is to delete the desktop settings file that comes with the mac, you can just ignore it.

I also shared the Rmarkdown Template file and Texrefcard file to write automated documents.
